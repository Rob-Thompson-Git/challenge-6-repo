# Description

This application utilizes JavaScript (and jQuery) to fetch weather data from the OpenWeather third-party API. When users search a city, the current weather, wind speed, and humidity is displayed, as well as a five day forecast. Previously searched cities are saved via local storage so users can search again with just one click!
